# Prediction using Unsupervised Machine Learning
This project aims to demonstrate the application of unsupervised machine learning techniques for prediction using a IRIS dataset.

# Dataset
This is the "Iris" dataset. Originally published at UCI Machine Learning Repository: Iris Data Set, this small dataset from 1936 is often used for testing out machine learning algorithms and visualizations (for example, Scatter Plot). Each row of the table represents an iris flower, including its species and dimensions of its botanical parts, sepal and petal, in centimeters.

# Project Overview
The project involves the following steps:

# Data Exploration: 
Analyzing and understanding the dataset, including its structure, features, and any patterns or trends present.

# Data Preprocessing:
Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis, which involve handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, or scaling numerical data.
As in dataset there was no missing values.

# Feature Engineering: 
Selecting or creating relevant features to improve the performance of the machine learning models.

# Model Building: 
Applying unsupervised machine learning algorithms K-means clustering.

# Model Evaluation: 
Assessing the performance of the models, which may include metrics such as inertia, or visual inspection of clusters.
